# TEDx Talks Unsupervised ML Analysis

This document provides a step-by-step analysis and explanation of the notebook `ted.ipynb` for managerial review. Each step is described with its purpose and expected outcome.

## 1. Importing Libraries
- **Code:** `import numpy as np`, `import pandas as pd`
- **Purpose:** Loads essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis.

## 2. Loading the Dataset
- **Code:** `df = pd.read_csv('tedx_datase.csv')`
- **Purpose:** Reads the TEDx dataset into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

## 3. Data Exploration
- **Code:** `df.head()`, `df.columns`, `df.info()`, `df.describe()`
- **Purpose:**
  - `df.head()`: Displays the first few rows to get an overview of the data.
  - `df.columns`: Lists all column names in the dataset.
  - `df.info()`: Shows data types and non-null counts for each column.
  - `df.describe()`: Provides summary statistics for numerical columns.

## 4. Importing Additional Libraries
- **Code:** `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`, `import nltk`, `import string`, `import warnings`
- **Purpose:** Prepares for data visualization, text processing, and handling warnings.

## Next Steps (based on notebook structure)
- Further steps likely include text preprocessing, feature extraction (e.g., TF-IDF), clustering, and visualization. Each step should be documented with its purpose and expected result.
